# DOCKER_DEFAULTS provides the information needed to work with docker

# Variables that can be used in the values
# %(BASE_PATH)s will be replaced with the actual folder where erp-worbnch is installed
# %(USER_HOME)s the home folder of the logged in user

DOCKER_DEFAULTS:
    # the name of the containe in which all database are created
    dockerdb_container_name: 'db'
    # dockerdbuser is used to access the database  in the database container
    dockerdbuser: 'odoo'
    # dockerdbpw is the dockerdbuser's password

    # dockerrpcuser is the user with which we want to login to the odoo site running in the container
    dockerrpcuser: 'admin'
    # dockerrpcuserpw dockerrpcuser's password
    # this is in most cases NOT 'admin'
    # you can overrule it with -ddbpw

    # dumper_image:
    # when dumping a container based odoo site to its backup structure
    # a docker container is used that has access to databse container
    # where the sites data is maintained (normally this continer is named db)
    # to create a this dumper container we need an image which uses pgdump
    # to dump the db.
    # since pgdump is database version dependent, the database container
    # and the dumper container need to use the same pgdump version.
