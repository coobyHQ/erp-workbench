rename projects/redhelp/redhelp (if it exists) to a new name
pull odoo_instances
the recreate redhelp using:
bin/c -c redhelp
this should recreate the redhelp "buidlout" folders, and add a new alias redhelpw (next to the ones existing)
when building a site usin bin/c -c XXX, a new workon entry is created for XXX, which is activated executin XXXwg
with the alias d for deactivate you can deactivate an actual virtualenv
you can try the whole process like this:
ooin; git pull # to pull the newest stuff
ooli; git pull # to get the newest site descriptions
ooin # to get back to odoo_instances
bin/c -c redfruba # to create redfruba, my demo object not yet fully working
in a new shell: redfrubaw -> this will activate the redfrubaw virtual env, and change to its project folder
bin/build_odoo # this will download and create odoo
bin/dosetup_odoo.py # this will create the config file 
bin/odoo # this will start odoo and create a the redfruba database

sure let me try this

8:49 AM
the thing, that is not yet working as i want, is the automatic creation of a database with demo data
there are tests in redfrubas testfolder
to run them, you have to have a database with demo data
to creat it proceed as follows:
stop a running redfruba
dropbd redfruba # if it exists
redfrubaw # to activate virtualenv
bin/odoo_bin -c etc/tmp.conf # to start odoo without automatically creating a db
navigate to localhost:8069 and create a new fruba database with demo data as usal
stop  odoo
restart odoo by issuing bin/odoo
in a new shell execute:
ooin
bin/c -I redfruba # this will install a number of odoo modules like hr, crm ..
bin/c -uo all redfruba # this will install all redfruba modules (1 at the moment)
to run the tests issue:
redfrubaw
bin/odoo --test-enable -i redfruba --stop-after-init
