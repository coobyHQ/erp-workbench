Preparation:
------------
install the virtualenv wrapper according to the following instructions:
    http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

add instructions to .bashrc to add virtualenvwrapper when a shell is opened:

    # ------------------ start workon stuff -------------------
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/projetcs
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

take care that the last line (source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh) is korrekt.
It could be, that virtualenvwrapper.sh was installed to a different directory.

important:
make sure, that afther opening a new shell the following two conditions are met:
- no message after opening the shell like:
    /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh not found
- the command:
    which virtualenvwrapper.sh
    produces a valid result


Handling sites is divided into two parts:

- managing projects/sites (in the odoo_instances folder)
- running a site in the project folder

managing project/site:
----------------------
refresh list of projects:
    ooli # to cd into structure with list of projects
    git pull # to update It

create new project-structure:
    local project that is not managed in gitlab:
        bin/s --add-site-local NEW_LOCAL_NAME

    gloabbal project that IS managed in gitlab:
        bin/s --add-site NEW_NAME

    if a global site has bin added/edited, it must be checked in using git

acivate an existing project structure:
    bin/c -c PROJECT_NAME

    this command creates all folders needed to run a site in isolation.
    It also creates a virtual environment that can be easily activated.
    
    The following aliases are writen into ~/.bash_aliases:
    - PROJECT_NAME
        this cd's into the project folder
    - PROJECT_NAMEw
        this activates the projects virtual env, and cd's into its project folder
    - d 
        this deactivates an active virtualenv

building a project:
    to build an existing project we must build the odoo site

    PROJECT_NAMEw # to activate the virtual env
    bin/build_odoo.py # to download and build the site
    bin/dosetup_odoo.py # to create the config file

starting odoo:
    after having built a project, we can run it.
    Upon first start, a new database named PROJECT_NAME will be created

    bin/odoo

creating a database with demo-data:
    after having built a project, we can recreate the database, with the use demo-data flag set:

    bin/create_db
