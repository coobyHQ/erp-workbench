Preparation:
------------
install the virtualenv wrapper according to the following instructions:
    http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

add instructions to .bashrc to add virtualenvwrapper when a shell is opened:

    # ------------------ start workon stuff -------------------
    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/projetcs
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

take care that the last line (source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh) is correct.
It could be, that virtualenvwrapper.sh was installed to a different directory.

important:
make sure, that afther opening a new shell the following two conditions are met:
- no message after opening the shell like:
    /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh not found
- the command:
    which virtualenvwrapper.sh
    produces a valid result
