Ok, thanks for the information.

Here is something about me that i want to tell you.

I am working in odoo since one and half year and implemeted more than 4
systems for the clients.

I am working as a frintend and backend developer so you can say complete
package for odoo. I have also developed android and ios apps and used odoo
as a backend.

For apps i am comfortable for both like hybrid and native, for hybrid i am
using ionic framework.

Right now i am going to launch my own product in odoo which is connector
for gitlab and odoo, everything in odoo and gitlab will going to sync with
real time and my goal for this product is a performance without any delay
data should be sync.

As a frontend development, i am able to design full website in odoo with
customizable themes so anyone can update content and layout by himself.
Currently there is 3 themes in odoo store which is design by me.

Above all things is about odoo, but i am not limited to only odoo i am also
working in php in php i have total 3 years of experience. Within this 3
years i got full knowledge about wordpress, magento, zoomla, codeignitor,
laravel, symfony.

I have one developer who is working for me for the angular projects.

So if you want to test my knowledge than you can assign me trial task, and
for trial task i will not charge you.

And one thing that i want to tell you is my work amd performance of the
apps will give you 100% satisfaction and i believe that time is most
important so i am able to deliver the things on time with 100% satisfaction.

IN FUTURE IF YOU HAVE ANY PROJECT FOR ME YOU CAN CONTACT ME AND I CAN
DELIVER IT WITH LOWEST COST ON TIME

Regards,
SAHIL
