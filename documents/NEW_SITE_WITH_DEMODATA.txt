Hi friends,

here is a series of commands to execute to create a new local

odoo database for redhelp (just replace redhelp for any database)

This new database will have *loading of demodata* activated!

This has to be done only once (it is a bit lengthy) until you really need to start from afresh.

For now it is only tested on odoo 10, but is prepared to work also on odoo 11 and flectra.
